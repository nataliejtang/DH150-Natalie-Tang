# Public Spaces Impacted by COVID-19: U.S. Department of Education 
## DH150: Assignment 8 by Natalie Tang

## Introduction: a brief information about the project
The coronavirus has profoundly impacted how we interact with the world and has drastically increased the need for online platforms. Now, more than ever, it is important that public websites are both easy to navigate and aesthetically pleasing. In this project, I will propose a new UX design of the U.S Department of Education website that will allow users to navigate the site more easily. Given the ongoing situation, students, teachers, and parents alike are curious about how the coronavirus will impact the future of education on every level (from elementary school to postsecondary school). This would likely increase traffic onto the Department of Education website because people are searching for updates from reliable sources (e.g. government websites). 


## Clear design statement: 
The current design of the U.S. Department of Education website is functional; however, its simplistic design ironically makes it more difficult to efficiently navigate. The website includes a lot of repeated information and while the layout of the site is straightforward, it remains relatively plain which makes a user's experience much less pleasant. The U.S. Department of Eduation acts as a storage platform for all types of information-- news releases, educational data, resources, and more. This can often overwhelm the user, especially if the information is not laid out in a consistent and logical manner. It is crucial for these issues to be resolved so that users do not become frustrated or confused while utilizing the website.
