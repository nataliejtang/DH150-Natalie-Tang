# Public Spaces Impacted by COVID-19
## DH150 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation by Natalie Tang

Over 170 countries across the globe have confirmed cases of coronavirus. In the United States, 41 states are under mandatory stay-at-home orders and life as we knew it dramatically changed around mid-March. The commute to work looks much different now from what it once was. Students from elementary schools all the way to the university level are now completing school online and at home. Over 6 million people have filed for unemployment. People are rallying support for small businesses that will be heavily impacted by forced closures and decreasing sales. I have chosen to evaluate two public spaces that have been affected by the coronavirus--the department of education and the minority business development agency. As a result of this ongoing pandemic, the education system has had to quickly adapt to become accessible to all kids and adults from home which requires new technology, new teaching methods, etc. Similarly, small businesses owners/workers have been more heavily impacted by COVID-19 than larger, chain stores. Small businesses have become more creative to try and boost sales or are forced to close down altogether. I am specifically focusing on minority business because people of color are disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus which would, in turn, affect minority businesses. 

### Website 1: U.S. Department of Education
https://www.ed.gov

The Department of Education (ED) exists to "promote student achievement" by ensuring equal access and encouraging educational excellence. To do this the ED (1) oversees and distributes federal education funding, (2) collects data and conducts research on schooling in the U.S., (3)identifies and draws attention to major educational issues and (4)enforces federal regulations prohibiting discrimination in programs that recieve federal funding. 

The opening page of the department's website is standard and includes four main headings that relate to the four action items that ED is responsible for that were listed above--student loans, grants, laws, and data. There are pictures below the main headings with the exact same titles which are redundant and unecessary. Overall, I would say that this website is very cluttered and does not have a clear ... The other headings on the website seemed to just be thrown together and 

### Website 2: Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA)
https://www.mbda.gov

The Minority Business Development Agency was created by the U.S. Department of Commerce and aims to promote growth of minority businesses whith the use of different programs, policies, and research. The Agency has created many centers that facilitate this growth by providing assistance services to Minority Business Enterprises (MBEs). 

The website opens to a rotating highlight reel with a prominent heading of "loans and grants" directly below it. It also features the latest news/tweets concerning minority businesses as well as where to locate one of their centers,more about the inclusive innovation initiative, and access to the agency's research library that has statistics on minority businesses in the United States. The menu bar is tucked away in the far right corner and opens in a way that is not standard to most websites. Due to the positioning of the menu bar, the user is led to focus more on the center of the page and the heading in tiny font that reads, "NOW OPEN: Nevada and New Mexico MBDA Business Center Grant Competitions." Overall, .....


## Heuristic Evaluation Severity Scale

1 = low priority, cosmetic problem only
2 = should be given attention if the correct resources and enough time are available, causes a minor usability problem
3 = requires immediate attention, causes a major usability problem

## Website 2 Heuristic Evaluation - MBDA
### 1. Visibility of System Status
- Hovering over any links or pictures on this website causes background movement and/or the arrow colors will change in order to signal to the user that they are about to move to a different part of the website if they proceed. However, some arrows turn red when they are hovered over while others do not. Similarly, any option in the drop-down menu bar does not change color or move when the mouse is hovering over it. These inconsistensies can confuse the user and lead them to wrong parts of the website because the user's actions are not being communicated properly. Severity Rating (1)

### 2. Match Between System and the Real World
- This website uses typical business language such as "private equity and venture capital sourcing" which may seem acceptable given this website is geared towards people who own businesses. On the contrary, this can actually discourage people who are not farmiliar with these terms from starting a business which is counterproductive to the goal of the MBDA. Severity Rating (1)
- Similar to when you meet a new person, users may be expecting some sort of general introduction to what the SBDA is/does on the openning page. Currently, the home page focuses on featured, relevant highlights and loans & grants. Although there is an "About" page located in the drop-down menu, it would be valuable to add at least a sentence or short statement somewhere on the home page so that first-time users will not feel flustered when using this website. Severity Rating (1) 
- This website has done a good job at matching icons to their respective titles which would be consistent with user expectations. For example, the title "Find a Business Center" is paired with an office building icon and the title "Research and Data" is paired with a graph and folder icon. 

### 3. User Control and Freedom 
- If the user selects any icons/links that lead the user outside of the MBDA's website a new tab is opened. For example, if a user selects share to facebook a new tab will open with a proposed facebook message. Typically, I find it much more convenient if I can just click the back button as opposed to closing out a whole new tab. Severity Rating (1)
- The drop-down menu bar does not remain visible to the user at all times as it disappears the further down the user scrolls. This prevents users from easily accessing other parts of the website and can make the user feel trapped. Severity Rating (2)
- This website supports user control and freedom by providing a "cancel" button when subscribing to their email service. 

### 4. Consistency and Standards
-
- feedback vs contact ?? are they the same thing // tools & resources 
- there is a downward arrow in the dataset that says "state/US" and when clicked on realphabetizes the list of states; however, typically arrows like that signal that you can collapse/expand a long list so I was confused when it reordered them instead of compressing them. 

### 5. Error Prevention

### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
- no search history for searches
- the subtitles in the menu bar do not appear at all times if you want to visit another part of the website you must click on the menu bar ALSO the menu bar is only located at the very top and does not travel down the page as one scrolls
- good -- offer a drop down list for filters for their site locations and data for all minority businesses
-- good- links turn purple after they have been clicked on so the user does not get confused

### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
- good: there is a back to the top arrow button once you start scrolling 
- user has the option to filter different characteristics of MBEs in the data that is provided but cannot save only the filtered items -- only option is to download the entire csv file 

### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
- For the most part the design is aesthetic and minimalist making it easier for users to navigate. However, the colors do not complement each other -- the highlight reel vs what is below it -- the overpowering pink color and blue on blue. Seems like it only focuses on loans and grants because there are no visible options bc no menu bar that is always present

### 9. Helps Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

### 10. Help and Documentation
- no help or frequently asked questions section of the website 
- there is a place to provide feedback but no place to ask questions-- it is unclear whether this feedback page is for asking questions says it is a place for "comments, concerns, etc." but not questions (3)
