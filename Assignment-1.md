# Public Spaces Impacted by COVID-19
## DH150 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation by Natalie Tang

Over 170 countries across the globe have confirmed cases of coronavirus. In the United States, 41 states are under mandatory stay-at-home orders and life as we knew it dramatically changed around mid-March. The commute to work looks much different now from what it once was. Students from elementary schools all the way to the university level are now completing school online and at home. Over 6 million people have filed for unemployment. People are rallying support for small businesses that will be heavily impacted by forced closures and decreasing sales. I have chosen to evaluate two public spaces that have been affected by the coronavirus--the department of education and the minority business development agency. As a result of this ongoing pandemic, the education system has had to quickly adapt to become accessible to all kids and adults from home which requires new technology, new teaching methods, etc. Similarly, small businesses owners/workers have been more heavily impacted by COVID-19 than larger, chain stores. Small businesses have become more creative to try and boost sales or are forced to close down altogether. I am specifically focusing on minority business because people of color are disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus which would, in turn, affect minority businesses. 

### Website 1: U.S. Department of Education
https://www.ed.gov

The Department of Education (ED) exists to "promote student achievement" by ensuring equal access and encouraging educational excellence. To do this the ED (1) oversees and distributes federal education funding, (2) collects data and conducts research on schooling in the U.S., (3)identifies and draws attention to major educational issues and (4)enforces federal regulations prohibiting discrimination in programs that recieve federal funding. 

The opening page of the department's website is standard and includes four main headings that relate to the four action items that ED is responsible for that were listed above--student loans, grants, laws, and data. There are pictures below the main headings with the exact same titles which are redundant and unecessary. Overall, I would say that this website is very cluttered and does not have a clear ... The other headings on the website seemed to just be thrown together and 

### Website 2: Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA)
https://www.mbda.gov

The Minority Business Development Agency was created by the U.S. Department of Commerce and aims to promote growth of minority businesses whith the use of different programs, policies, and research. The Agency has created many centers that facilitate this growth by providing assistance services to Minority Business Enterprises (MBEs). 

The website opens to a rotating highlight reel with a prominent heading of "loans and grants" directly below it. It also features the latest news/tweets concerning minority businesses as well as where to locate one of their centers,more about the inclusive innovation initiative, and access to the agency's research library that has statistics on minority businesses in the United States. The menu bar is tucked away in the far right corner and opens in a way that is not standard to most websites. Due to the positioning of the menu bar, the user is led to focus more on the center of the page and the heading in tiny font that reads, "NOW OPEN: Nevada and New Mexico MBDA Business Center Grant Competitions." Overall, .....
