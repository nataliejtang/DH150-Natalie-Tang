# Public Spaces Impacted by COVID-19: U.S. Department of Education 
## DH150: Assignment 8 by Natalie Tang

## Introduction: a brief information about the project
The coronavirus has profoundly impacted how we interact with the world and has drastically increased the need for online platforms. Now, more than ever, it is important that public websites are both easy to navigate and aesthetically pleasing. In this project, I will propose a new UX design of the U.S Department of Education website that will allow users to navigate the site more easily. Given the ongoing situation, students, teachers, and parents alike are curious about how the coronavirus will impact the future of education on every level (from elementary school to postsecondary school). This would likely increase traffic onto the Department of Education website because people are searching for updates from reliable sources (e.g. government websites). 

## Clear design statement: 
The current design of the U.S. Department of Education website is functional; however, its simplistic design ironically makes it more difficult to efficiently navigate. The website includes a lot of repeated information and while the layout of the site is straightforward, it remains relatively plain which makes a user's experience much less pleasant. The U.S. Department of Eduation acts as a storage platform for all types of information-- news releases, educational data, resources, and more. This can often overwhelm the user, especially if the information is not laid out in a consistent and logical manner. It is crucial for these issues to be resolved so that users do not become frustrated or confused while utilizing the website.  

## Competitor analysis:
To get a sense of how public spaces were presenting information during the coronavirus pandemic I conducted hueristic evaluations on two websites -- the U.S. Department of Education and the Minority Business Development Agency. I chose to analyze these two sites because the education system and small businesses have been havily impacted by COVID-19. Schools across the nation were forced to convert to online learning on short notice and small businesses have suffered dramatically from declining sales and stay-at-home orders that have put operations on hold. By evaluating these two websites I was able to better understand how these sites are able to present a plethora of resources effectively to the public.

## User research:
I had a general idea about how people (students, parents, etc.) would traditionally find resources and updates regarding their education -- through educational offices and updates from their own institutions. However, with the changing circumstances, the online dissemination of information has become increasingly important. I needed to learn more about what users needed and wanted from online platforms. I was able to do this by conducting user research with my roommate, a UCLA pre-med student. She offered to give her insights to how she usually finds educational resources and her thought process when visiting websites. The user analyzed the UCLA website, a site she was relatively farmiliar with, and answered questions about how she is finding/not finding resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.

# UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
It is essential to develop empathy for users to develop a design that is effective and suits the needs of users. To embrace the perspectives and needs of potential users for the U.S. Department of Education website I created multiple personas, scenarios, user journeys, and empathy maps. I created personas from 3 different age categories to emphasize that people of all ages need access to the resources that the Department of Education has to offer and need to be able to navigate efficiently. These personas and stories help keep the design focused on the user and helped me throughought the remainder of the design process.

# Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment06)
The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to test how different features on the website flow together while also testing the site's overall functionality. Based on my research in previous assignments, I have chosen three different design problems to fix: the search bar, headings & layouts, and a recently viewed function.

# High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)
The following is an interactive, high-fidelity prototype of the U.S. Department of Education website. This prototype was created and developed on Figma. The prototype focuses on three features that are based on the (slightly adjusted)personas of Mikayla Beck, Rosa Torres, and Kristina Lee (refer to Assignment 5).
