## Introduction: a brief information about the project
The coronavirus has profoundly impacted how we interact with the world and has drastically increased the need for online platforms. Now, more than ever, it is important that public websites are both easy to navigate and aesthetically pleasing. In this project, I will propose a new UX design of the U.S Department of Education website that will allow users to navigate the site more easily. Given the ongoing situation, students, teachers, and parents alike are curious about how the coronavirus will impact the future of education on every level (from elementary school to postsecondary school). This would likely increase traffic onto the Department of Education website because people are searching for updates from reliable sources (e.g. government websites). 

## Clear design statement: 
The current design of the U.S. Department of Education website is functional; however, its simplistic design ironically makes it more difficult to efficiently navigate. The website includes a lot of repeated information and while the layout of the site is straightforward, it remains relatively plain which makes a user's experience much less pleasant. The U.S. Department of Eduation acts as a storage platform for all types of information-- news releases, educational data, resources, and more. This can often overwhelm the user, especially if the information is not laid out in a consistent and logical manner. It is crucial for these issues to be resolved so that users do not become frustrated or confused while utilizing the website.  

## Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
The opening page of the department's website is standard and includes four main headings that relate to the four action items that ED is responsible for that were listed above--student loans, grants, laws, and data. There are pictures below the main headings with the exact same titles which are redundant and unecessary. Overall, I would say that this website is very cluttered and does not have a clear focal point. The structure of the website, however, is simple which makes it easy for a user to navigate.

# User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:
This project will support users that are seeking more information about the education system itself as well as relevant updates regarding how one's education may be impacted by current events (e.g. COVID-19). This will benefit the public in that it will keep people informed and provide users with resources to answer any questions that he or she may have. Centralized information about education will positivelt impact people of all ages -- from kids in elementary school to adults enrolled in higher education and concerned parents/grandparents alike. Current solutions to finding information include [... read more >>](https://github.com/nataliejtang/DH150-Natalie-Tang/blob/master/Assignment-4.md)

# UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
I explored the personas of three different users that all had different goals in visiting the U.S. Department of Education website.

# Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment06)
The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to test how different features on the website flow together while also testing the site's overall functionality. Based on my research in previous assignments, I have chosen three different design problems to fix: the search bar, headings & layouts, and a recently viewed function.

# High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)
The following is an interactive, high-fidelity prototype of the U.S. Department of Education website. This prototype was created and developed on Figma. The prototype focuses on three features that are based on the (slightly adjusted)personas of Mikayla Beck, Rosa Torres, and Kristina Lee (refer to Assignment 5).
