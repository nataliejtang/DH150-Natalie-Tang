# Contextual Inquiry 
## DH 150: Assignment 4 by Natalie Tang
### Step 1: Main Design Challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users?
 This project will support users that are seeking more information about the education system itself as well as relevant updates regarding how one's education may be impacted by current events (e.g. COVID-19). This will benefit the public in that it will keep people informed and provide users with resources to answer any questions that he or she may have. Centralized information about education will positivelt impact people of all ages -- from kids in elementary school to adults enrolled in higher education and concerned parents/grandparents alike.  
  
#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
 Looking at Maslow's heirarchy of needs, this activity fulfills the user's basic need for safety. With access to necessary resources and information regarding education, users will feel more "safe" in that they do not have to worry about how they will find the answers to their questions.  

#### What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Current solutions to finding information include in-person visitation to informational school offices (e.g. the financial aid office, etc.). Similarly, people may find this information online via specific school websites or news outlets. If these more "formal" options do not suffice, people may be inclined to ask firends or family that may have had the same questions that would be able to share how they found the information that they were looking for. 

#### What are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Current limitations to finding necessary educational resources include not knowing where to look due to an abundance of resources and long wait times at in-person offices that can discourage people from searching for the information that they need. Digital technology via a centralized website would allow the user to find accurate information more quickly and would be able to guide the user in the right direction through various headings and search capabilities. 

### Step 2: Identifying Target Users

#### What are the characteristics of users? 
Demographic: people that have gone or are going to school (e.g. college students and recent grads), parents, grandparents

Preferences: users that are currently enrolled in school or know someone that is enrolled in school because they will most likely need to find information about the education system

Expertise: users do not need any particular level of expertise to navigate this website 

#### Where would the users do that activity?
Users would complete this activity in the comfort of their own home or really in anywhere with internet access. Having a centralized informational source online allows information to be accessible to more people at any time of the day.

#### What would the users do to complete that activity?
To search for information and resources about education, users will visit a website (for this activity, the myUCLA website) and explore headings and search options to find the information that they are looking for. 

### Step 3: Research Methods
Ideally, I would utilize two different research methods: ethnographic research and participatory observation.
 - Ethnographic research is a method in which researchers observe a participant in their real-life environment. Under normal conditions, I would observe students who are coming in and out of Murphy Hall, a building on UCLA's campus that has many resource offices such as CAC, the financial aid office, the registrar's office, and others. I would be able to ask students if they were successful in finding the answers to their questions based off of their visit to a given office. Unfortunately, I will be unable to conduct this in-person research due to the campus closure brought on by COVID-19.
 - I conducted participatory observation research with my friend, a current UCLA student who fits the demographics that I mentioned above. See the next section(s) for the materials that I used to conduct this research and the results of the activity.
