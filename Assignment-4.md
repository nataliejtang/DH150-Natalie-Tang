## DH 150: Assignment 4 by Natalie Tang
### Step 1: Main Design Challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users?
  This project will support users that are seeking more information about the education system itself as well as relevant updates regarding how one's education may be impacted by current events (e.g. COVID-19).

### Step 2: Identifying Target Users

#### What are the characteristics of users? 
Demographic: people that have gone or are going to school, parents, 

Preferences: users that are looking for more information 

Expertise: users do not need any particular level of expertise to navigate this website 

#### Where would the users do that activity?

#### What would the users do to complete that activity?

### Step 3: Research Methods
