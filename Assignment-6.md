# Low-Fidelity Prototype
## DH 150: Assignment 6 by Natalie Tang

#### Purpose of Low-Fidelity Prototyping

#### Specific Features To Be Addressed
1. The Search Bar -- The U.S. Department of Education provides an overwhelming amount of resources for its users. If users know what they are looking for (through keywords or phrases), then the user can find information more quickly by utilizing the search bar. The search bar can prove even more useful if it can provide the user with autofill suggestions while he or she is entering something into search. 

2. Headings & Layout -- Most people are looking for main headings to guide their experience when visitng a particular website. These need to be placed optimally on the page so that users will be able to notice them and interact with them. Similarly, this relates to the proper layout of the homepage so that the most pressing information is presented to the user from the start. This makes it so that the user does not have to spend unneccesary time searching through the website. 

3. Recently Viewed -- There is a lot of content and resources available on the U.S. Department of Education website. With that being said, it may be difficult for the user to distinguish a source that they have visited from one that they have not visited. Users may also need to refer back to sources that they have previously visited. Providing users with a recently viewed tab will allow them to easily access this information.
