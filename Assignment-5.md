## DH 150: Assignment 5 by Natalie Tang

### Personas

### Scenarios

1 - Searchability through the search bar located in the upper right corner
2 - Large, clear headings and an organized home page
3- Accessible, aggregated information that can be accessed through a "recently viewed" tab 

#### Scenario 1 
##### Why Mikayla is using this website
Mikayla, a third year undergraduate student, is excited about applying to medical school this summer and wants to find out more relevant information about the application process (including how to pay for grad school). Additionally, with the global coronavirus pandemic, Mikayla wants to stay updated on how COVID-19 is going to impact her in undergraduate and graduate school. Mikayla is overwhelmed with a heavy course load and long hours at the hospital as a volunteer. Mikayla uses her phone and laptop to stay informed about what is going on in regards to her education. Mikayla uses the U.S. Department of Education website as a resource to search for specific topics (e.g. grad school, COVID-19).

#### How Mikayla is using this website
With such little free time, Mikayla needs to get answers about specific questions quickly. In order to do this, Mikayla uses the search bar of the Department of Education website. This allows her to decrease her time spent clicking on random links on the website and increase her overall efficiency. After using the search bar, Mikayla can skim the short descriptions offered below each search option to determine which resource will best match her need. 

#### Scenario 2
##### Why is Rosa using this website
Rosa is a caring grandmother that wants to stay informed about how the coronavirus is impacting her grandkids and their schooling. She is concerned about their online learning. Rosa does not know how to navigate the internet very well, but wants to have access to the various resources that are provided online (according to her grandkids at least). Rosa decides to use the family desktop computer to search for her needs. 

##### How Rosa is using this website
Since Rosa is new to the online world, she relies heavily on bold headings to guide her on the site. Rosa particularly spends a long time looking at the home page to determine what she needs to click on next. Rosa uses the headings and information on the homepage to find what she is looking for.

#### Scenario 3
##### Why is Kristina using this website
Kristina is an executive at a film company that cares for her two children that are about to graduate from high school. She is generally very aware of what is going on in the world and in her kids' lives but wants to know information about grant/loan options for her kids that will be attending college as well as how COVID-19 will impact their futures. 

##### How is Kristina using this website
Kristina typically gets information from lots of different sources and visits multiple websites to get the answers she needs. However, Kristina discovers that the Department of Education has all that she needs in one place. With the vast amount of information provided on this website, Kristina often needs to look at the previous links that she has clicked on to recall information. Kristina can see that links will turn purple after she clicks on them and now there is a conveniently located "recently viewed" tab where she can easily access all of these documents in one place and does not have to navigate to and fro.
