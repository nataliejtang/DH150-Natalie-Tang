# High Fidelity Prototype
## DH150: Assignment 7 by Natalie Tang

### Description, Process, and Purpose
The following is an interactive, high-fidelity prototype of the U.S. Department of Education website. This prototype was created and developed on Figma. The prototype focuses on three features that are based on the (slightly adjusted)personas of Mikayla Beck, Rosa Torres, and Kristina Lee (refer to Assignment 5). These tasks are detailed further below. 

This prototype is a result of several different steps in the design process. Through the usability test I was able to identify  user interactions that could be improved upon. After this, I created three different personas that adressed the interaction problems based on the characteristics and needs of that persona. I then created a low-fidelity prototype which included hand drawn wireframes and wireflows. I transformed the wireframes of my low-fidelity prototype into a high-fidelity prototype. I was able to further refine my prototype thanks to feedback from my peers. 

The purpose of this interactive, high-fidelity prototype is to visualize the proposed UX/UI related improvements that I would like to make to the U.S. Department of Education website in a format that users can easily and logically navigate.
