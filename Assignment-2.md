For the U.S. Department of Education, the usability issues that I would like to address based off of my heuristic evaluation are as follows: 

-
  - This issue is addressed in task 1

My target audience for this usability test was college age students and older (i.e. parents or recent grads) because they would be most likely to use the Department of Education's website. This usability test was conducted using "ActivePresenter" which recorded the participant's screen, audio, and facial expression.
