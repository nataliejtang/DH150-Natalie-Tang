# Pilot Usability Testing: U.S. Department of Education
## DH 150: Usability Testing by Natalie Tang

### Usability Testing and Goals
Usability testing measures how easy or difficult it is for both recurring and first time users to navigate a given website or app. A participant is asked to perform realistic tasks on a given website or app while verbalizing their thoughts and feelings about the website and various tasks that they must perform. Ultimately, this data is collected, analyzed, and used to improve the overall effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of a website. Usability testing is important and effective because it keeps the user at the center of the design process by providing developers with new perspectives that allow them to address major and minor usability flaws that may have been overlooked. 

For the U.S. Department of Education, the usability issues that I would like to address based off of my heuristic evaluation are as follows: 

-
  - This issue is addressed in task 1
 
 - links that lead to a different website without notifying the user 
  - This issue is addressed in task 2 
  
 - inconsistency about what is a link and what is not
  - This issue is addressed in task 3
  
 - a cluttered interface that overwhelms the user
  - This issue is addressed throughout all 3 tasks

This test was performed remotely at the participant's home on a laptop. Ideally, this test would have been performed as a one-on-one with the participant and moderator in a designated testing environment. This would allow the moderator to guide the participant and clarify any questions that he or she may have. Unfortunately, this was not possible given the current state of the world. My target audience for this usability test was college age students and older (i.e. parents or recent grads) because they would be most likely to use the Department of Education's website. This usability test was conducted using "ActivePresenter" which recorded the participant's screen, audio, and facial expression.

### Reflection
In regards to the U.S. Department of Education's website, I learned that it can be difficult for a user to navigate with the overwhelming amount of content available to the user on each page. This was apparent through my participant's facial expressions and the amount of time it took her to scan the whole page to find what she was looking for. Similarly, ... The ... my participant when she could not determine if "teacher loan forgiveness" was a clickable linnk and when she attempted to click on "formula grants" but 

Through this pilot usability test, I learned the importance of being detailed and explicit in my directions to the participant. I wrongly assumed that the participant would solve the task in the way that I did which resulted in the participant thinking that she found the correct items when she did not. For example, the participant was asked to find three different types of formula grants. The only way I was able to find these three types was by searching "formula grants" in the search bar. It was unfair of me to expect my user to have the same thought process as me. I failed to realize that everyone thinks differently and there are many ways to get to the same end result. In order to improve this, I will change the words that I use for each task to be more clear and direct. As I previously mentioned, the participant thought that she found the correct pages/items in tasks two and three when she actually did not. To address this problem I could either provide a screenshot of what the end result would look like or encourage the participant to keep searching via a facetime call or something of that nature. This would allow me to clear up any confusion that the participant may have. It would also be beneficial if I could further encourage the participant to verbalize all of his or her thoughts, feelings, and actions. The participant in my pilot test verbalized her actions rather than her thoughts which made it much more difficult to find out what her overall experience with the usability of the website was.
